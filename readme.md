# Semantic HTML

This project was built by following along to the [Crafting Meaningful HTML] course on [LinkedIn]. It is about semantic HTML and the importance of using the correct tags and attributes for specific contents. There are some very important and yet little known tags for navigation, images, lists, citations, dates and so on. By utilizing them correctly, our pages work better and for more people and programs.

## Install and Run

Since this is simply an HTML page, it's just a matter of opening it on the browser.
